    "history":"After acquiring a CompTIA A+ certification I worked for Tandy Corporation repairing PCs and other hardware. At the same time I studied for and completed Microsoft MCSE testing. Following that I worked for two Microsoft contractors before getting a contract job with Regence Blue Shield as a Support Technician. After 8 months I was offered a full-time position and stayed at Regence for about 9 years. During that time I earned additional Microsoft certifications as new Microsoft Operating Systems were adopted by Regence. Upon return from the Philippines in 2013 I picked up another Microsoft certification for Windows 7 and accepted a Support Technician position at Healthpoint Community Health Centers later moving into an IS Project Support Specialist position until August of 2015 when I took time off to complete course-work at Code Fellows earning a certificate in Advanced Javascript Development.",
    "likes":"I like building websites using the skills I've been learning recently but enjoy most anything related to electronics or computers. For a few years I spent a lot of time designing and building home audio speaker systems. In addition to some basic woodworking skills it involved setting up a testing environment with microphones and computers to measure frequency response and other performance metrics. It also required using different software applications for prototyping cabinet shape, size and acoustic properties. I even set up a little company called Alegria Audio in order to sell my creations with the names Ling, Rosa, Aria, Emma, Ruby and Tom. I received many postive comments from my customers along with postive professional reviews. In the end I decided it was a better hobby than a business but I wouldn't mind doing it again. I also enjoy traveling to new places and trying to get a feel for the history and culture of the place I'm visiting."
